# **Ash’s Modbus RTU Tester**  
### *For when you need to speak fluent Modbus RTU and want to look cool AF while doing it.*

## What Is This?

**Ash’s Modbus RTU Tester** is a (thankfully) dark-themed, feature-packed, ""highly-engineered"" desktop tool that lets you:

- Scan serial ports for RS-485 tools
- Connect to any Modbus RTU device via RS-485  
- Read Holding Registers, Input Registers, Coils, and Discrete Inputs  
- Write to coils or holding registers (responsibly… preferably not while the machine is in production...come on boys....)  
- View raw and scaled values, including signed/unsigned handling  
- Log every operation in plain English so even non-Modbus people can follow along  
- Do all this *without* ever touching a command line

Whether you’re debugging an ESP32, reading sensors, configuring industrial controllers, or desperately trying to understand why the register map says one thing and the device does another — this tool has you covered.

## Features

### **Serial Port Scanning (Auto + Manual Refresh)**
Plug in your USB–RS485 adapter.  
Click **Refresh**.  
Boom — ports appear.  
Magic.  
(The good kind, not the black-magic-Modbus kind.)

### **All Major Modbus Data Types**
Read:
- **Holding Registers (FC3)**
- **Input Registers (FC4)**
- **Coils (FC1)**
- **Discrete Inputs (FC2)**

Write:
- **Holding Register (FC16)**  
- **Single Coil (FC5)**

If a register type can't be written (e.g., Input Registers), the GUI will politely tell you to stop trying to break the universe.

### **Scaling, Signed/Unsigned, Decimals**
Automatically scale register values:
- Want `1234` to become `12.34`? → Set decimals to `2`.
- Want to treat a 16-bit register as a signed int? → Tick **Signed**.
- Want to cause Modbus chaos? → Don’t use scaling and pretend it’s the device’s fault.

### **Live Data Table**
Every read populates a three-column table:
- **Address**
- **Raw Value**
- **Scaled Value**

Columns auto-resize, text is centre-aligned, and values are displayed cleanly.

### **Operation Log**
A timestamped log explains:
- What function code was used  
- What registers were touched  
- What values were read/written  
- Successes  
- Errors  
- Your life decisions  

All in easy human language, not the cryptic nonsense Modbus usually gives you.

### **Dark Navy Theme**
High-contrast, professional, and easy on the eyes during late-night debugging sessions.  
Looks good enough that people might think you know what you’re doing.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyQt5**
- **pyserial**
- **minimalmodbus**
- An RS-485 adapter  
  *(Please don’t try talking Modbus through HDMI. Someone has done this before.)*

## Install required packages:


pip install PyQt5 pyserial minimalmodbus

### Installation  
Clone or download this repository

Install the dependencies above

Plug in your USB–RS485 adapter

### Run the tester:

python modtest.py  
#### Welcome to the world of clean Modbus debugging.

## Usage
**1. Select COM Port**  
Use the dropdown or hit Refresh.  
If nothing appears, check your cables, your drivers, and your life choices.  
  
**2. Choose Serial Settings**  
Baud rate, parity, data bits, stop bits — all the classics.  
Defaults match most industrial devices.  
  
**3. Pick Register Type**  
Choose from:  
Holding Registers  
Input Registers  
Coils  
Discrete Inputs  
  
**UI adapts automatically (e.g., scaling disabled for bit types).**  
  
**4. Set Start Address & Count**  
Tell the tester how many values you want.  
(Up to 125 registers — because Modbus has rules and we follow them.)  
  
**5. Click “Fetch Data”**  
Watch the table fill and the log scroll.  
Feel powerful.  

**6. Write Values**  
Pick an address  
Enter a value  
Click Write Value  
**Be responsible**....... Like seriously....  
  
### Double-check before writing to coils connected to anything that's in prod, near people or can cause any mischief...   

Seriously

I see you

## Tips, Tricks & Real-World Wisdom
- If a read fails, 90% of the time it's the baud rate.

- If a write fails, 90% of the time it's the slave ID.

- If nothing works, 90% of the time your RS-485 A/B wires are backwards.

- If things work intermittently, your ground reference is probably laughing at you.

- If everything works perfectly, celebrate — you are now a Modbus professional.
(Or extremely lucky....... or a witch)


# Roadmap
### (a.k.a. Features That Might Exist If Future-Me Is Feeling Energetic..... or you bug me enough)

- Batch reads/writes

- Live graphing of register values

- Saving/loading device profiles

- CRC visualiser

- Hex inspector

- Automatic detection of slave address

- “Chaos Mode™” — writes random values to everything
